## 🔧 Installation

### Install from Tabby Plugin Store

1.  Open Tabby settings and navigate to **Plugins → MCP**.
2.  Locate and click "Install" on the **Tabby VSCode Agent** plugin.
3.  Restart Tabby to finalise the installation.
4.  Proceed to configure VS Code with the MCP Server as detailed below.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1.  Ensure the plugin is installed using one of the methods above.
2.  Launch Tabby and go to **Settings → Copilot**.
3.  Within the settings page, you'll find a collapsible **"Instructions"** section. This provides detailed, step-by-step guidance on how to integrate the agent with VS Code.
4.  Configure the MCP server port (default: `3001`).
5.  Toggle "Start on Boot" if you wish for the server to automatically launch with Tabby.
6.  Connect your preferred AI client to the MCP server. A list of supported clients can be found at [https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients).

## 💻 Usage Examples

### Connecting an AI to Control Your Terminal

1.  Start Tabby with the Tabby VSCode Agent plugin enabled.
2.  Configure your AI client to connect to the MCP server (refer to [Connecting to MCP](#-connecting-to-mcp) for details).
3.  Instruct your AI assistant to run commands or manage your terminal sessions.

Example AI prompt:
```
Connect to my Tabby VSCode Agent and list all available terminal sessions.
Then execute the command "ls -la" in the first available terminal.
```

## 🔗 Connecting to MCP

### HTTP Server (Recommended for most clients)

To configure AI clients to use your MCP server, add the following to your `mcp.json` file:

```json
{
	"servers": {
		"tabby": {
			"url": "http://localhost:3001/sse",
			"type": "http"
		}
	}
}
```

### Stdio Server (for VS Code)

For a more robust integration with VS Code, you can utilise the bundled `stdio` server.

1.  Navigate to **Settings → Copilot** in Tabby.
2.  Under the **Stdio Server** section, you will find the full path to the server script.
3.  Click the "Copy" button to copy the path to your clipboard.
4.  In your VS Code `mcp.json`, configure the server as shown below, pasting the copied path:

```json
{
    "servers": {
        "tabby-stdio": {
            "type": "stdio",
            "command": "node",
            "args": ["<PASTE THE COPIED PATH HERE>"]
        }
    }
}
```

### Pair Programming Mode

The plugin includes a "Pair Programming Mode" to enhance safety when AI assistants control your terminal:

-   **Confirmation Dialogue**: Prompts the user for confirmation before executing commands.
-   **Auto Focus Terminal**: Automatically focuses the terminal when commands are executed.
-   **Command Rejection**: Provides the ability to reject commands with feedback.

To enable Pair Programming Mode:

1.  Go to Tabby settings → Copilot.
2.  Toggle "Enable Pair Programming Mode".
3.  Configure additional safety options as required.
