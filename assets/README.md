# Assets Directory

This directory contains media files for demonstration purposes used in the main README.md and documentation.

## Directory Structure

```
assets/
├── images/    # For static images like screenshots and diagrams
├── videos/    # For video tutorials and demonstrations
└── gifs/      # For animated GIFs showing features in action
```

## Usage in README

When adding media to the README.md, use the following format:

```markdown
![Description](assets/images/screenshot.png)
```

For GIFs:

```markdown
![Demo](assets/gifs/demo.gif)
```

## Guidelines for Media Files

1. **Keep file sizes reasonable**:
   - Images: Optimize to < 500KB
   - GIFs: Keep under 2MB when possible
   - Videos: Use YouTube links for longer videos

2. **Use descriptive filenames**:
   - Good: `terminal-command-execution.gif`
   - Bad: `screenshot1.png`

3. **Add captions**:
   - Include descriptive alt text for all media
   - Example: `![Terminal showing MCP command execution](assets/images/terminal-demo.png)`

4. **Resolution**:
   - Use reasonable resolutions (800-1200px width recommended)
   - Ensure text is readable in screenshots
