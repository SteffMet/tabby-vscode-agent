# Animated GIF Demonstrations

## Suggested GIF Demonstrations

Consider creating the following animated GIFs to showcase features:

1. **Terminal Command Execution**
   - Show an AI executing a command and the command running in the terminal
   - Filename: `ai-command-execution.gif`

2. **MCP Server Connection**
   - Demonstrate the connection process between AI and terminal
   - Filename: `mcp-connection.gif`

3. **Terminal Buffer Access**
   - Show retrieving and displaying terminal output
   - Filename: `terminal-buffer-access.gif`

4. **SSH Session Management**
   - Demonstrate listing and managing SSH sessions
   - Filename: `ssh-session-management.gif`

5. **Command Aborting**
   - Show safely aborting a running command
   - Filename: `abort-command.gif`

## GIF Creation Guidelines

1. **Keep it focused**: Each GIF should demonstrate one feature clearly
2. **Keep it short**: 5-15 seconds is ideal
3. **Resolution**: 1280x720 is recommended (or smaller if needed)
4. **File size**: Keep under 2MB for web performance
5. **Framerate**: 15-24 fps is usually sufficient
6. **Add annotations**: Consider adding text overlays to explain what's happening
7. **Use screen recording software** like:
   - LICEcap (Windows/macOS)
   - Gifox (macOS)
   - ScreenToGif (Windows)
   - Peek (Linux)

## Adding to README

Reference these GIFs in the README.md like this:

```markdown
![AI Command Execution Demo](assets/gifs/ai-command-execution.gif)
```

The main README.md already references a demo.gif file which should be placed in this directory.
